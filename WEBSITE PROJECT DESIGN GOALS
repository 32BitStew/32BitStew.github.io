WEBSITE PROJECT DESIGN GOALS

HEADER:
	PORTRAIT
		DRAWN
		CIRCLE FRAME
	LABEL,
		LOOKS LIKE PASTED LABEL (TEXTURED)
		CAN I TEXTURE THE FONT?
	SOCIAL
		-_- IF I HAVE TO

TABS:
	LABELS TEXT
		ABOUT (CV), GAMES, FILM, COMICS, WRITING
		SIZE OF TABS, ROUGHLY ; SCRATCHY FONT OR FORMAL ONE?
	FOLDERS STACKED DIAGONALLY
		SMALL OVERLAP BETWEEN TAB LABELS
	TAB BEHAVIOR
		SHOULD SLIDE IN AND OUT BASED ON SCREEN SIZE
			MINIMUM SIZE SHOULD HAVE VERT STACK
			MAXIMUM SIZE SHOULD SLIGHTLY OVERLAP
			TEXT SHOULD BE LEGIBLE EITHER WAY
		TABS SLIDE OPEN ON HOVER
			WHEN CLOSED TABS ARE 33% OF THE SCREEN
			WHEN ONE IS OPEN IT SHOULD UP TO 50%
			INSIDE SLIDES SHOULD BE A ROLLING (?) PREVIEW OF WORK
	UNDER THE TABS
		ANIMATED GRAPHIC OF OFFICE SPACE
			LIZARDS? PERHAPS
			BUILT FROM HTML ELEMENTS SPAWNING, ANIMATING AND DISAPPEARING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE SCREEN
			PERHAPS IN A STATIC SPACE IF IN A SIMPLE BROWSER
